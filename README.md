# Java Game Engine Example 2

### About
This is an example game created with my [Simple Java Game Engine](https://github.com/red-dragon65/Simple-Java-Game-Engine) that shows how to put logic together to make a basic game.

**Game rules:** Collect triforce before enemies. If enemies collect more triforce than you, you lose!
            You can kill enemies if they collide with you from above.
            You only have three lives. If an enemy collides from left, right, or below, you lose a heart!

**IDE** - IntelliJ

## **HOW TO**
Check out the [Simple Java Game Engine on Github](https://github.com/red-dragon65/Simple-Java-Game-Engine) readme for help on getting this project working in IntelliJ.
